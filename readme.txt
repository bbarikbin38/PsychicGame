I am not sure what the point of the CSS is for the simple version of this homework. 

You can start the game by clicking on the middle of the screen and 
then clicking on any letter to guess what the computer is thinking of.
You have 9 tries until you add a loss.  If you get the letter correct,
the game will think of a new letter and restart the game, keeping your score.


Please play and let me know what you think!
